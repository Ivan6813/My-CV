# IVAN LINKEVICH

## Frontend Developer

### ABOUT ME
I worked at OAO “Naftan” (LLC “Naftan”) for 7 years as a senior operator. Thanks to that experience I learned how to work with a team structure, organize, prioritize and delegate work, multitask. I have developed an aptitude for quick decision making in critical situation, keeping a cool head. I am able to assimilate a large amount of information in short period of time, delve into the principle of work, which in turn helps me quickly master new technologies. The reason why I decided to change the field of activity is the insufficient realization of my potential within the framework of this profession.
